### 4. **Complete the Checkout Logic Using TDD**

#### Scope of Work:
- Added **Jest-based assertions** to test the checkout logic and ensure compliance with the provided requirements.
- Followed a **Test-driven development (TDD)** approach to implement the checkout functionality.
- Wrote **integration tests** to detect and resolve bugs during the checkout integration.

#### Skills Used:
- Test-driven Development (TDD)
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- Jest Framework



### 5. **Deploy the QKart Backend Server**

#### Scope of Work:
- Set up a **MongoDB Atlas** instance and uploaded product data to the cloud database.
- Deployed the QKart **Node.js backend** to **Heroku** for hosting.
- Deployed the QKart **React frontend** to **Netlify** and configured it to interact with the deployed Node.js backend.

#### Skills Used:
